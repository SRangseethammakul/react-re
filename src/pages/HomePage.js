                  Will you do the same for me? It's time to face the music I'm
                  no longer your muse. Heard it's beautiful, be the judge and my
                  girls gonna take a vote. I can feel a phoenix inside of me.
                  Heaven is jealous of our love, angels are crying from up
                  above. Yeah, you take me to utopia.

                  Standing on the frontline when the bombs start to fall. Heaven
                  is jealous of our love, angels are crying from up above. Can't
                  replace you with a million rings. Boy, when you're with me
                  I'll give you a taste. Thereâ€™s no going back. Before you met
                  me I was alright but things were kinda heavy. Heavy is the
                  head that wears the crown.

                  Playing ping pong all night long, everything's all neon and
                  hazy. Yeah, she's so in demand. She's sweet as pie but if you
                  break her heart. But down to earth. It's time to face the
                  music I'm no longer your muse. I guess that I forgot I had a
                  choice.
